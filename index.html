<blockquote>  The UEFA Europa League (abbreviated as UEL) is an annual football club competition organised 
      by UEFA since 1971 for eligible European football clubs. Clubs qualify for the competition based on 
      their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions. It is now the second-tier competition
      of European club football, ranking below the UEFA Champions League and above the UEFA Europa Conference
      League after being a third-tier competition from 1971 to 1999 before the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was
      discontinued.[1][2] Previously called the UEFA Cup, the competition has been known as the Europa
      League since the 2009–10 season,[3][4] following a change in format.[5] <br>

<blockquote>In 1999, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was abolished and merged with the UEFA Cup.[6] For the 2004–05 
    competition a group stage was added prior to the knockout phase. The 2009 re-branding included a merge
     with the UEFA Intertoto Cup, producing an enlarged competition format, with an expanded group stage 
     and a change in qualifying criteria. The winner of the UEFA Europa League qualifies for the UEFA Super
     Cup and, since the 2014–15 season, the following season's UEFA Champions League, entering at the group
     stage.  </blockquote>
